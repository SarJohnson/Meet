 ### Serverless Functions
This app will utilize serverless functions in a multitude of ways. My Meet app will be using serverless functions when users filter events by city, when users filter by number of events they would like to see, when users show specific event details, and when users show charts displaying event details. By using serverless functions for these details I won't have to worry about the infrastructure behind the functions because the functions will be deployed individually within the cloud.
